This project is based on the book [Zero To Production In Rust: An introduction to backend development](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html).

Due to some necessities I Had to make some small changes to the project:

1. On chapter 5, I didn't deploy to the Digital Ocean service
   1. I'm still looking for a place to host this application cost free.
2. On chapter 7, I changed from the Postmark email provider to the MailTrap email provider
   1. Changed to avoid using a work email or a email from a purchased domain of my own.
